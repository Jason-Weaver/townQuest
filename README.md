A text based adventure game

Though no code was copy-pasted, the ideas and means are from https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2014/12/11/making-a-text-adventure-game-with-the-cmd-and-textwrap-python-modules/. Extensions on this base idea include: different rooms and items, the item type food, the addition of people (dialog/descriptions/etc.), idea of health and sleep, time, money, ...

To Do:
0. Read/write state of game for saving progress
1. Read/write config portion of file (rooms, people, items) to separate config file
3. Make config portion of file (rooms, people, items) classes instead of lists
   - increased readability, maintainable, inheritance , etc.
4. The ability to have things cost other things (bartering)
5. Have Room Hours kick people out
